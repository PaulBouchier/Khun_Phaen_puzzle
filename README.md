A solver for the Khun Phaen / Prisoner / Escape / Sunset puzzle

The Khun Phaen puzzle, also known as Prisoner, Escape, Sunset, and maybe others, requires moving the prisoner
(Khun Phaen) block past the 9 guards who are there to prevent him from escaping the 4x5 prison.
Khun Phaen is a poem-story famous in Thailand - see

where it is positioned at the exit slot. The starting position is arbitrary and can easily be changed
